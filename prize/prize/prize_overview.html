<p id="titoli">Motivations and objectives</p>
<p>
The Centre for Post-Graduate Training and Research in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology, internationally known as ROSE School, was founded in the year 2000, with the purpose of favouring the growth of knowledge, culture, wisdom and sapience, under the conviction that whilst accessibility of information must be regarded as a positive conquer, human direct interaction is fundamental to allow the cultural growth of both lecturer and student. After eight years of progressive success of the ROSE School and unanimous recognition of its international leading status, it was felt that the time was mature to establish a prestigious prize to be attributed to individuals who have best interpreted the spirit and the vision of the School, in its aim of excellence in teaching, research and human relations. The Prize is attributed with a frequency of two years or more. The Prize consists of an art piece created by a renowned sculptor who tries to translate his own feelings and interpretation of earthquakes and their impact on human beings, environment and culture.

<p id="titoli">Selection Criteria</p>
<p>
The selection criteria places the emphasis on creative and innovative thinkers with demonstrated capacity of making major contributions to the field of earthquake engineering and engineering seismology. Whilst individuals will be essentially recognized for past accomplishments, the potential for future important achievements may also be taken into consideration. Examples of aspects to be considered may include (but are not limited to):
<ul>
	<li>Research results that have had a significant influence on development of new theories and lines of thought, as well as on practical application;
    <li>Exceptional and original contribution to the professional practice through influence on design guidelines/codes drafting, and through the participation and leadership in outstanding projects;
    <li>Exceptional achievements of former PhD students, thus demonstrating uncommon skills in education;
    <li>Creation of innovative educational programmes and other initiatives;
    <li>Public entrepreneurship through the advocacy, design, or delivery of effective risk mitigation measures or programmes;
    <li>Proposal and implementation of creative solutions to problems in engineering or other fields related to earthquake risk mitigation.
</ul>
The award is based on the degree to which the individual fits the overall profile of creativity, innovation and achievements in research and education, rather than based on a single accomplishment or product.
</p>
<br/>

<p id="titoli">Selection and Award Process</p>
<p>
The Selection Committee will review the nominations, and will be in a position to assign the prize to one of the candidates only on the grounds of a unanimous decision. If such decision cannot be taken, the prize will not be awarded. The recipient of the Prize will be invited to receive it at the ROSE School International Seminar of the following year.
